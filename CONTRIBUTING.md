We are very happy and grateful if you are willing to help us improve *ELPA*.
Thus, we would like to make this process as simple as possible for you,
but at the same time still keep it manageable for us

For recommendations and suggestions, a simple email to us (*elpa-library at mpcdf.mpg.de*) is sufficient!

1. You can use https://github.com/marekandreas/elpa to contribute with merge requests and issues.
2. Alternatively, if you use a public accessible git repository, please send us a merge request.
3. Last but not least, an email with a patch will also be ok. Please use *elpa-library at mpcdf.mpg.de*
